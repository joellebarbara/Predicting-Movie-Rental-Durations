# project name:
Predicting-Movie-Rental-Durations
# goal:
Build a regression model for a DVD rental firm to predict rental duration. Evaluate models to recommend the best one.
# Project Description
Time to put your regression knowledge to the test! A DVD rental company has approached you to make a regression model which will help predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD. The model will hopefully make their inventory planning much more efficient. You decide to help them by running some regression models and recommending the best-performing model to the company.
